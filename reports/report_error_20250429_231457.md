Based on the error log, the issue is a `ZeroDivisionError` occurring in the `test3` function in `/app/app.py` where it's attempting to divide by zero. Here's the solution:

1. Code patch in diff format:
```diff
diff --git a/app.py b/app.py
index abc1234..def5678 100644
--- a/app.py
+++ b/app.py
@@ -49,5 +49,8 @@ def test2():
 
 @app.route('/test3')
 def test3():
-    return 1/0
+    try:
+        return 1/0
+    except ZeroDivisionError:
+        return "Error: Cannot divide by zero", 400
```

2. Explanation of the fix:
- The original code had a hardcoded division by zero operation which will always raise an exception
- The fix wraps the operation in a try-except block to handle the error gracefully
- Instead of crashing the application, it now returns a meaningful error message with a 400 Bad Request status code
- This follows Flask's error handling best practices by:
  - Preventing application crashes
  - Providing clear feedback to API consumers
  - Using appropriate HTTP status codes

3. Testing suggestions:
- Unit test the endpoint:
```python
def test_test3_endpoint(client):
    response = client.get('/test3')
    assert response.status_code == 400
    assert b"Cannot divide by zero" in response.data
```

- Integration test scenarios to verify:
  - The application doesn't crash when accessing the /test3 endpoint
  - The response contains the expected error message
  - The HTTP status code is correct (400)
  - Other routes continue to work normally

- Additional improvements to consider:
  - Log the error for debugging purposes
  - If this is an API, return JSON formatted error instead of plain text
  - Consider whether the division by zero is intentional (for testing) or accidental (needs proper calculation logic)
  - Add input validation if the endpoint should accept parameters for division operations
